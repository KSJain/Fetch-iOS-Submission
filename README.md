Hello !

Thank you for taking a moment to review this repo. 

I have created a simple app uning outlined API endpoints and call it T.R.E.A.T.S
Here, I have followed my routine process of adding feature into an app.

I have added a few screens, view models, service protocols, production and test service and unit test. Also, included is a 3rd party library to cache images.

It is always so much fun to create a fresh project from scratch and there is so much excitement to add anything to an open ended requirement project.
However, I have tried to keep it simple and minimal

Hope you have a good experience going through my code. 

Thank you :)
